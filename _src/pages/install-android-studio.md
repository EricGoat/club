1. [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) for your platform
2. Run through the install process.
 * On OSX, this will involve dragging Android Studio.app into Applications.
 * On Windows, this runs through a standard install wizard.
 * On Linux, this depends on your distro; in some cases you may extract a tarball and run studio.sh in it, on some you may have it in your package manager
3. When launching it for the first time, a popup should appear to finalize the install process and download the right SDKs for your environment. The following screenshots will walk you through this:

Finally, you should see this getting started page. When you get here, you're set and ready to go! If you don't have an Android phone, you might want to go ahead and install Genymotion (third-party program) as well.
